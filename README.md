# Project Flutter

## Run Instructions
1. Navigate to both the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
2. Run `npm install` in each directory to install dependencies.
3. Start the development servers:
   - In both directories, run `npm run dev`.

*(Side note: Docker setup is kinda gg üôè)*

1. **What specific insights are you hoping to gain from capturing intermediary coding steps?**  
   For instance, if the aim is to identify common debugging patterns, the trace data might need to be structured differently than if the focus were on workflow efficiency or user experience.

2. **Are there specific error types or execution outcomes to highlight in the `execute_code` results?**  
   The example JSON includes `"execution_result": "error"`, but to make the data more informative, should we categorize errors (e.g., syntax vs. runtime errors)? Knowing this will help in capturing meaningful distinctions in the debugging process.
